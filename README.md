# Cipher-Project
A Caeser and Vigenere Cipher
#
The first program recieves a text file to either encrypt or decrypt using a Caeser or Vigenere Cipher. If any positive integer is inputted as the key, then that is the shift for the Caeser Cipher. If a '-1' is inputted, then the user is prompted for a text file that will be used as a key for a Vigenere Cipher.
#
The second program uses an inputed text file and calculates the Index of Coincidence. 
#
#
For example:
The file: Book2.txt is the file being encrypted.
#
The file: key.txt is used as the key for the Vigenere Cipher (the key is 'test').
#
The file: output.txt is the output after running the program.
